## 📌 Why Vyrade?

> AI is exploding — but chaos reigns.  
> With over **30,000 AI tools** and no clear benchmarks, most users are left confused or skeptical.  
> **Vyrade** fixes this with workflows, not opinions.

✅ Make AI tools comparable  
✅ Show real-world use cases  
✅ Foster a contributor-driven knowledge engine
