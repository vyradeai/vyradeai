## 📌 Why Vyrade?

> AI tools are exploding. But discovery is broken.  
> 70% of users can’t find the right tools. 60% don’t trust reviews.  
> **Vyrade** fixes this with open workflows, real-world usage, and trustless comparisons.

✅ Make tools comparable  
✅ Show real use cases  
✅ Foster a contributor-powered ecosystem
